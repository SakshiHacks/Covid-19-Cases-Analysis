This repository provides supplementary material for a lecture on COVID-19 data analysis, focusing on 
teaching students how to apply data science best practices through the development of a prototype 
project. The course, available on Udemy, walks students through the process of modeling and 
analyzing COVID-19 data using Python. It emphasizes a hands-on approach, with step-by-step 
instructions on how to gather, clean, and analyze data, ultimately leading to the creation of dynamic
